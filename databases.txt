DATA WONT BE STORED IN MEMORY

databases aren't itneracted with directly
Database Management Systems (DBMS) are in between to access the database

Relational:
    MySQL
    POSTGRESQL
    ORACLE

NOSQL:
    ORACLE
    MongoDB
    DynamoDB
    etc.

SQL is used to communicate with DBMS

When installing POSTGRESQL, Separate Databases can be isolated from one another.
Allows for applications to interact with different databases.

Primary Keys -> unique IDs, usually 

Not NULL can be added toa  record in POSTGRESQL


ORM
midpoint between database and api

FOREIGN Keys
how we relate two tables together
one to many, ex) one user can create many posts but each post can only be linked to one person


DATABASE MIGRATION
devs can track changes to code and rollback code ez with GIT
db migrations enable tracking incremental changes to schema and rollback any time
this can be achieved with alembic
alembic can also auto pull db models from sql alchemy and generate proper tables
